Hi, I'm Technicalish.

I write, speak and share everything that I learn and I think is useful to be shared with the world or with myself.

I love what I do, so I share what I learned about Forensics, Hacking, Automation, Personal improvement, and many more. If you love these topics as well, you will feel right at home here.

These quotes below explain the reason for starting my blog.

>"New ideas need audiences like flowers need bees. No matter how brilliant, they will die unless others work to spread them." - Simon Sinek

>"If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive - no matter how skilled or talented you are." - [Cal Newport, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_MDA1XVX6C2B5P3EJGBGB?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

I combat digital distraction and trying to live my life using technology but not be consumed by it. Your attention is the product that is being sold. - [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/the-film/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

>"Simply put, humans are not wired to be constantly wired." - [Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525536515/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_CX9B6C0QHQGBDXXM33F8){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

I build this world brick by brick, one small share at a time, and I will continue to do so. Thank you so much for your support, my reader.

A share from you would help me a lot to grow this world.

Therefore

If you enjoy my writing, follow me for even greater things that come.

>**Disclaimer:** Yes, I do work. But the opinions here are my own. You can share everything you read, but before you take the advice, think with your head. :)

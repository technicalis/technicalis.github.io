# Hack The Box - Netmon

## Description
Netmon is an easy machine that focusses on misconfigurations. The main issue consists of using RCE in the PRTG software.<br>

## Information Gathering

### Step 1: Enumeration
Start with running good olde nmap to enumerate the target machine.<br>

```bash
# sudo nmap -sC -sV -A -v -p- -Pn -T4 -oN NMAP/netmon_TCP 10.129.230.176
```

We got a FTP service, webservice and SMB that is interesting on the target.<br>

When checking the webserver I can see a PRTG Network Monitor interface.<br>

Let's now check if the FTP service accepts anonymous connections.<br>
```bash
# netexec ftp 10.129.230.176 -u '' -p '' --ls
```

The SMB server accepts anonymous connections. This means I'm able to login to the FTP service and browse the shared folders.<br>

## Exploitation

### Step 2: Open SMB server

Let's see what we can find on this open SMB server.<br>
```bash
# ftp anonymous@10.129.230.176
```

Browsing this open SMB server I can download the user.txt<br>

# Privilege Escalation
Now I need to find a way to elevate my privileges on the target.<br>

Let's check the C:\ drive. Maybe I can find more information about the PRTG service we found.<br>
```bash
# ls -la
```
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-5.png)<br>

I found the Network Monitor config files at the default location "C:/programdata/Paessler/PRTG Network Monitor".<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-6.png)<br>

Let's look in the backup of the configuration file "PRTG Configuration.old.bak". Maybe there are some credentials as these are sometimes stored inside the configuration files.<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-7.png)<br>

When trying these credentials on the prtg admin login it did not work. But changing the 2018 to 2019 did the trick! Seems like the password policy is a bit soft at this company. Now I can login to the PRTG admin dashboard.<br>

Googeling a bit on this software and the version I found a blogpost about a RCE vulnerability for this particular version of PRT Network Monitor.<br>
https://codewatch.org/2018/06/25/prtg-18-2-39-command-injection-vulnerability/<br>

For this to work I need to make a new notification. We can do this at Setup -> Account Settings -> Notifications.<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-9.png)

Here we hit the + sign and let everything default except for "Execute Program".<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-10.png)

On the Execute Program option we select the demo.ps1 file and in the parameter we put our own command to execute. I will put a command here to create a new user and add this user to the administrators group. This would be an easy way in if it works.<br>
```
# test.txt;net user tech Password123! /add;net localgroup administrators tech /add
```
When I click save, I get send back to the main notification page. Here I can trigger my home made notification as a test.<br>
To do this, I need to select the notification I just made and on the right panel I can click on the bell icon to test it.<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-11.png)

Now I get the following test message.<br>
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-12.png)

After a couple of seconds I should be able to use our newly created account!
Let's test if the tech account is available on the target.<br>
```bash
# netexec smb 10.129.230.176 -u 'tech' -p 'Password123!'
```
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-13.png)
This user should be an admin user. I can see using netexec that the (Pwn3d!) is shown after the credentials. This means that this user is indeed an administrator and I pwnd the machine.<br>

I can now use impacket-psexec to log in to the target with our new admin user tech.<br>
```
# impacket-psexec tech:"Password123\!"@10.129.230.176
```
![alt text](/assets/screenshots/netmon/image-14.png)

Now I'm able to get the root.txt!<br>

## Conclusion
To summarize this machine. It was a machine with open SMB shares that we could misuse to browse the target C:\ drive where we found credentials for the PRTG network Manager. Next there was an RCE vulnerability in the PRTG software used. This gave us a way to elevate privileges to admin and pwn the machine.<br>

## Lessons Learned
- Check the restictions on the SMB server and if it should be enabled.
- Always update softwware to the newest version if there are known exploit.
